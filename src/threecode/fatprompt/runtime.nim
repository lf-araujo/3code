## Live fat-prompt runtime.
##
## This module owns the prompt/footer/editor/spinner side effects used while a
## turn is running. The turn controller calls these helpers directly and also
## registers them as API stream hooks. `api.nim` must not import this module.

template pendingHint*(): untyped = fatPromptState.footer.pendingHint
  ## Carries the latest iteration's accurate usage forward. Two roles:
  ##   1. After each `callModel` iteration, used to repaint the **token
  ##      bar** with accurate values (replacing the live rough ones).
  ##   2. On user submit (next turn), the saved values become the
  ##      **token receipt** — the repaint of the previous bar's row
  ##      in the same cyan tone, leaving the receipt in scroll history
  ##      while a fresh bar (at zeros) takes its place at the new bottom.
  ## See `## Token UI` in `CLAUDE.md` for the full lifecycle.

template currentBarLabel*(): untyped = fatPromptState.footer.barLabel
  ## What's currently shown in the live bar. Updated by every paint
  ## (live during streaming, accurate after `callModel` parses usage,
  ## zero on first turn). Used by `writeTranscriptWithFatPrompt` to repaint the bar
  ## with the same label after a content write hides it.

template currentBarHasGap*(): untyped = fatPromptState.footer.hasGap
  ## Whether there's a one-row blank "gap" between the bar and the
  ## row above it. Set by `endTurn` (typing-ready state — the gap
  ## sits between the last LLM line and the bar, breathing room
  ## while the user reads). Cleared by every `paintBarPrompt` /
  ## `paintBarBelow` (during streaming, the bar slides flush with
  ## content — no gap mid-turn). Read by `emitUserSubmit` so the
  ## receipt repaints the gap row in place — overwriting the blank,
  ## leaving the receipt flush below the LLM content with no
  ## permanent gap in scroll history.

  ## Set by the persistent prompt's `onSubmit` after an idle Enter;
  ## cleared by `wizardReadLine` once the modal returns. The
  ## persistent prompt's `getCh` parks while this is true (and
  ## `inputModalActive == false`) so the controller has a chance
  ## to drain the event; the wizard's `getCh` deliberately ignores
  ## it. See the wizard protocol header above `wizardRequest`.
var inputModalActive*: Atomic[bool]
  ## Held for the lifetime of a modal wizard, including the gaps
  ## between `wizardReadLine` calls while the wizard's caller does
  ## post-processing (verify round-trip, status lines, ledger
  ## writes). The input thread's editor hooks consult this flag and
  ## skip their work while it is set, so the wizard owns the
  ## terminal without racing the hook bodies. A torn read of a
  ## closure field (one word zero, the other the prior value) is a
  ## SIGSEGV when the input thread calls the torn closure, so all
  ## hook bodies must check this flag instead of relying on the
  ## modal to nil the field.
  ##
  ## Successful submits keep the flag held: the wizard's caller may
  ## still be writing to stdout (the verifier line and
  ## `added <name>` status both land after the last prompt submits).
  ## The controller calls `wizardFinish` once the entire sequence,
  ## including caller post-writes, has flushed. Cancel and EOF
  ## release it inline because there is nothing left to race and the
  ## cancel handler's in-place `fullRedraw` already anchors the
  ## prompt.

# --- Modal wizard RPC. The controller (main thread) blocks in
#     `wizardReadLine` while the input thread runs a one-shot
#     `readLineWith` for the wizard prompt. The input thread is the
#     only owner of stdin and the termios raw mode, so routing the
#     wizard through it eliminates the dual-`posix.read` race that
#     caused flaky cancel + SIGSEGV on `:provider edit`/`:provider add`.
#
#     ## Protocol (one round-trip)
#
#     1. Main thread (caller of `wizardReadLine`): fills
#        `wizardRequest` under `wizardRequestLock`, then sets
#        `wizardRequestPosted = true`. The lock is for the request
#        struct only — the posted/response flags are atomic and
#        lock-free.
#     2. Input thread (running `inputThreadProc`): the persistent
#        `readLineWith`'s `getCh` sees `wizardRequestPosted == true`
#        and returns the `wizardSentinel` (-2). `readLineWith`
#        raises `WizardSwitched`; the outer loop's `except
#        minline.WizardSwitched` branch clears the editor and
#        `continue`s to the top.
#     3. Input thread (top of outer loop): sees
#        `wizardRequestPosted == true`, clears the flag, sets
#        `inputModalActive = true` (gates the hook bodies so the
#        wizard owns the terminal), reads the request, sets
#        `deferSubmit = false` + `submitIcon = ""` (the wizard's
#        values; the persistent prompt is parked, so no save
#        needed), and runs a one-shot `minline.readLineWith` with
#        the same `getCh` / `writeProc` / `hasPendingInput`
#        closures the persistent prompt uses.
#     4. The wizard's `readLineWith` returns (Enter → submit,
#        Ctrl-C / ESC → `InputCancelled`, Ctrl-D on empty →
#        `EOFError`). The input thread's `except` branches build a
#        `WizardReadResponse`, `finally` restores
#        `deferSubmit`/`submitIcon`, the unified publish path
#        stores the response and sets `wizardResponsePosted = true`.
#        On cancel / EOF the flag also clears `inputModalActive`
#        immediately; on a successful submit the flag stays held
#        until the controller calls `wizardFinish`, so the input
#        thread does not race the wizard caller's post-processing
#        (verify round-trip, status lines, ledger writes) by
#        repainting the persistent prompt on the row the wizard
#        just left. The input thread `continue`s back to the outer
#        loop, where it parks in `inputModalActive` (or exits to
#        the persistent `readLineWith` when the controller finally
#        releases the flag).
#     5. Main thread: wakes up, reads the response under the lock,
#        resets the editor fields, clears `inputIdleLinePending`,
#        and either returns the line or raises `InputCancelled` /
#        `EOFError`. The successful-submit path leaves
#        `inputModalActive` held; the controller must call
#        `wizardFinish` after the wizard's caller has fully
#        processed the response and flushed its terminal output, so
#        the input thread can repaint the persistent prompt on a
#        fresh row.
#
#     ## Why not a condvar
#
#     We match the existing `releaseIdleSubmittedInput` /
#     `consumeQueuedInput` idiom: an atomic flag + 5ms `sleep`
#     poll. The wizard prompts are interactive (user typing speed)
#     so 5ms latency is invisible. A condvar would shave the
#     wakeup latency but would not simplify the code (we'd still
#     need the lock for the request/response structs, and the
#     persistent prompt's `getCh` already needs the
#     `wizardRequestPosted` flag for its own yield check).
#
#     ## Call sites covered
#
#     All production modal prompts go through `wizardReadLine` via
#     `ui.readRequired` / `ui.readOptional`. The standalone
#     `minline.readLine` is test-only (sets its own termios raw
#     mode, no input thread). `api.conn.readLine` is the HTTP read,
#     not a UI prompt. No production code uses `editor.readLine`
#     directly. Audited 2026-01; no exceptions found.
